Tiny Town: Gallery Shooter

Tiny Town: Gallery Shooter is a 2D browser based game created using Phaser.js, a popular JavaScript game development framework. This game pays homage to classic arcade style shooters, combining pixel art, animated effects,
and interactive gameplay to create an engaging experience. The playerâ€™s goal is to defend the whimsical world of Tiny Town from waves of incoming alien invaders and a powerful boss enemy.

The game begins in a peaceful village rendered with tiles and sprite art. The player takes control of a character who can move left and right across the screen and fire projectiles upward.
The game escalates as more enemies appear, culminating in a boss battle. The boss enemy moves back and forth across the top of the screen and fires projectiles toward the player. The player must survive the assault and defeat the boss to win the game.

From a design perspective, Tiny Town emphasizes simplicity and accessibility. The game can be played directly in a web browser without needing to install any additional software. 
It features intuitive controls players use the A and D keys to move left and right, press SPACE to shoot, and R to restart the game. Victory is signaled by an animated text display, and a health and score tracker is displayed in the top left corner for continuous feedback.

The project is structured for clarity and ease of development. Assets, such as images and sound files, are organized into dedicated folders. 
The source code is split across multiple files, with each scene or game mechanic encapsulated in its script. A primary configuration file initializes the game and loads all necessary scenes.

Audio and animation play a critical role in creating a lively and responsive atmosphere. Enemies explode with a puff animation, and custom sound effects enhance both combat and environmental immersion.
A looping background track plays during the boss fight, while a separate sound indicates victory.

This project is hosted publicly on GitHub and is also deployed using GitHub Pages. This makes it easy to share and play from any device with a web browser. 
The repository contains all code, assets, and instructions necessary to run or modify the game.
